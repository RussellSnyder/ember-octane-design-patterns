      title: Resuable Component Pattern
      subtitle: Write It Once, Use It Everywhere
      pattern_explanation:
        show: But Why? 
        hide: Ok, that's enough man....
        overview: passes initial data as individual, configurable properties and exposes an action to be handled in the calling context
        use_cases:
          u1: Building an Addon for the Ember Community :-)
          u2: Components that will be reused in various scenarios in different routes and with different models
        rabbit_holes:
          r1: A component will only be used with one model and should modify the data directly
          r2: A component should not be 'context aware' (know what the route has for state)
          r3: If the above is true, see the single purpose component pattern
