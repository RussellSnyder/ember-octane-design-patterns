        caption: UI state and Component state can fall in love with the declarative rendering pattern
      intro: this pattern is a great way to eliminate errors that happen when your component state is not inline with your UI.
        Although often quite small, UI bugs are some of the most annoying and hardest to find  
        This pattern can help you control those bugs and make Ember components that much more enjoyable to make :-)
    examples:
      carousel:
        title: photo carousel
        current_slide: The current slide is {currentSlideNumber}

      overview: Instead of relying on the DOM, declarative state management in Ember through computed properties enables a component to sync it's state with it's UI with little work!
